# 🎉 LAYER 2 TEOCOIN ESCROW SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Phase 3: Teacher Choice Escrow System - COMPLETE ✅

### 📋 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Layer 2 TeoCoin Escrow System** that allows students to apply TeoCoin discounts while giving teachers the choice to accept (reduced EUR + TeoCoin compensation) or reject (standard EUR payment) the discount. The system includes complete backend logic, frontend interface, API endpoints, and comprehensive testing.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Student Payment Flow:
[Student] → [TeoCoin Discount Applied] → [ESCROW CREATED] → [Teacher Choice] 
                                            ↓
                                     [7-Day Timer]
                                            ↓
[Accept: Reduced EUR + TeoCoin] ← [Teacher] → [Reject: Standard EUR Payment]
         ↓                                            ↓
[Student Gets Discount]                    [TeoCoin Returned to Student]
[Teacher Gets Compensation]                [Student Pays Full Price]
