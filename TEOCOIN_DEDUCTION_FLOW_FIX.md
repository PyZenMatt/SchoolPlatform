# 🔄 CRITICAL: TeoCoin Deduction Flow Fixed

## ❌ **Previous BROKEN Flow**
```
1. Frontend calls CreatePaymentIntentView ✅
2. Frontend calls applyTeoCoinDiscount ❌ → TEO deducted immediately  
3. User attempts Stripe payment 💳
4. If Stripe FAILS ❌ → Student loses TEO but gets no course!
```

## ✅ **New SECURE Flow** 
```
1. Frontend calls CreatePaymentIntentView ✅ → Only validates balance
2. User pays with Stripe 💳 → Payment processed
3. Frontend calls ConfirmPaymentView ✅ → TEO deducted ONLY if payment succeeds
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FRONTEND CHANGES NEEDED**

### 1. Remove `applyTeoCoinDiscount` calls
**File**: `frontend/src/components/courses/DBCourseCheckoutModal.jsx`

**BEFORE** (Line ~159):
```javascript
const data = await applyTeoCoinDiscount(course.id, teoNeeded, selectedDiscount);
```

**AFTER** (Remove completely):
```javascript
// Remove this call - TeoCoin now deducted automatically after payment
// const data = await applyTeoCoinDiscount(course.id, teoNeeded, selectedDiscount);
```

### 2. Update checkout flow
**Remove**:
- All calls to `applyTeoCoinDiscount`
- Any logic that deducts TEO before payment
- Balance updates before payment confirmation

**Keep**:
- Balance validation (can still check if user has enough TEO)
- Discount calculation for UI display
- Payment intent creation with discount

## 🔧 **Backend Changes Made**

### 1. `CreatePaymentIntentView` (payments.py)
- ✅ **Only validates** TEO balance
- ✅ **Creates Stripe intent** with discounted price
- ❌ **Does NOT deduct** TEO anymore

### 2. `ConfirmPaymentView` (payments.py) 
- ✅ **Verifies Stripe payment** succeeded
- ✅ **Creates enrollment** record
- ✅ **Deducts TEO** only after payment confirmed
- ✅ **Has duplicate protection** (won't deduct twice)

### 3. `ApplyDiscountView` (db_teocoin_views.py)
- ❌ **Deprecated** - returns HTTP 410 Gone
- ❌ **Frontend should not call** this endpoint anymore

## 🎯 **Migration Steps**

### For Frontend Developer:
1. **Remove all `applyTeoCoinDiscount` calls**
2. **Update checkout flow** to not deduct TEO upfront
3. **Keep discount UI** but remove actual deduction
4. **Test that payment flow works** without premature deduction

### For Testing:
1. **Create payment intent** with TeoCoin discount ✅
2. **Verify balance not deducted** yet ✅  
3. **Complete Stripe payment** ✅
4. **Verify TEO deducted** only after payment success ✅
5. **Test failed payment** - verify no TEO lost ✅

## 📊 **New Error Handling**

### Frontend will receive:
```javascript
// When calling deprecated applyTeoCoinDiscount
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "This endpoint is deprecated. TeoCoin discount is now applied automatically after payment confirmation.",
  "code": "ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED"
}
```

### Recommended frontend action:
```javascript
// Remove the applyTeoCoinDiscount call entirely
// Frontend should proceed directly to Stripe payment
// TeoCoin will be deducted automatically upon payment success
```

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

✅ **No premature deduction** - TEO only deducted after payment  
✅ **Atomic transactions** - Either both payment+deduction succeed or both fail  
✅ **User protection** - No lost TEO from failed payments  
✅ **Duplicate protection** - Prevents double deduction even with multiple calls  

## 🚨 **URGENT ACTION REQUIRED**

The frontend MUST be updated to remove `applyTeoCoinDiscount` calls or users will get deprecation errors and broken checkout flow.

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Breaks TeoCoin discount checkout  
**Timeline**: Update frontend immediately after backend deployment
