# API Path Fix - StakingInterface Issue Resolved

## Problem
The StakingInterface was encountering a 404 error with duplicate API paths:
```
/api/v1/api/v1/services/staking/info/
```

## Root Cause
The staking service was using absolute paths that included the `/api/v1/` prefix, while the API client already has `baseURL: '/api/v1'` configured. This caused path duplication.

## Solution
Updated all staking service endpoints to use relative paths:

### Before (Incorrect)
```javascript
const response = await api.get('/api/v1/services/staking/info/');
const response = await api.post('/api/v1/services/staking/stake/', {...});
const response = await api.post('/api/v1/services/staking/unstake/', {...});
const response = await api.get('/api/v1/services/staking/tiers/');
const response = await api.get('/api/v1/services/staking/calculator/', {...});
```

### After (Correct)
```javascript
const response = await api.get('/services/staking/info/');
const response = await api.post('/services/staking/stake/', {...});
const response = await api.post('/services/staking/unstake/', {...});
const response = await api.get('/services/staking/tiers/');
const response = await api.get('/services/staking/calculator/', {...});
```

## Result
- ✅ API calls now generate correct URLs: `/api/v1/services/staking/info/`
- ✅ StakingInterface should now load properly
- ✅ All staking endpoints are correctly routed
- ✅ Backend endpoints are already implemented and ready

## Backend Verification
Confirmed that all required endpoints exist:
- `/api/v1/services/staking/info/` → `staking_info` view
- `/api/v1/services/staking/stake/` → `stake_tokens` view  
- `/api/v1/services/staking/unstake/` → `unstake_tokens` view
- `/api/v1/services/staking/tiers/` → `staking_tiers` view
- `/api/v1/services/staking/calculator/` → `commission_calculator` view

The staking system should now work correctly with the frontend.
