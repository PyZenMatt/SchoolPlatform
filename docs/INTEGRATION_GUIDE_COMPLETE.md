## 🎮 **HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM**

### **For Students:**

1. **Check Course**: Browse courses and see discount options
2. **Request Discount**: Choose 5%, 10%, or 15% discount level
3. **Sign Once**: MetaMask signature for pre-approval (NO GAS!)
4. **Wait for Teacher**: Teacher gets real-time notification
5. **Get Approved**: Direct TeoCoin transfer when teacher approves

**Example Student Flow:**
```
Course: "Advanced Photography" - €100
Student wants: 10% discount (€10 off)
TEO Required: 100 TEO (€10 × 10 TEO/EUR)
Student Experience: 
  → Clicks "Request 10% Discount"
  → Signs pre-approval (NO GAS FEES!)
  → Waits for teacher notification
  → Gets approved → 100 TEO sent to teacher
  → Pays only €90 for course!
```

### **For Teachers:**

1. **Get Notification**: Real-time discount request alert
2. **Review Request**: See student, course, discount amount
3. **One-Click Decision**: Accept or decline with reason
4. **Receive Payment**: Direct TeoCoin to MetaMask wallet
5. **Earn Bonus**: Extra 25% TeoCoin from reward pool

**Example Teacher Flow:**
```
Notification: "Maria wants 10% off your course"
Details: €100 course, 10% discount (€10)
Teacher receives: 100 TEO from student + 25 TEO bonus = 125 TEO
Teacher decision: Click "Approve" (platform pays gas)
Result: 125 TEO appears in teacher's MetaMask wallet
```

---

## 💰 **ECONOMIC MODEL**

### **Exchange Rate**
- **1 TEO = €0.10** discount value
- **Examples**:
  - 5% discount on €100 course = €5 = 50 TEO
  - 10% discount on €100 course = €10 = 100 TEO
  - 15% discount on €100 course = €15 = 150 TEO

### **Teacher Incentives**
- **Direct Payment**: Student's TeoCoin goes to teacher's wallet
- **Bonus Payment**: 25% extra from reward pool
- **Example**: Student pays 100 TEO → Teacher gets 100 + 25 = 125 TEO

### **Platform Economics**
- **Gas Costs**: ~$0.50-2.00 per transaction on Polygon
- **Reward Pool Usage**: 25% bonus payments (sustainable)
- **Revenue Impact**: Increased sales through discount attractiveness

## 🔧 **CONFIGURATION OPTIONS**

### **Adjustable Parameters**

In `settings.py`:
```python
DISCOUNT_SYSTEM = {
    'REQUEST_TIMEOUT_HOURS': 2,      # Auto-decline after 2 hours
    'TEACHER_BONUS_PERCENT': 25,     # 25% bonus from reward pool
    'MAX_DISCOUNT_PERCENT': 15,      # Maximum 15% discount
    'TEO_TO_EUR_RATE': 10,          # 10 TEO = 1 EUR discount
    'MIN_DISCOUNT_PERCENT': 5,       # Minimum 5% discount
}
```

In smart contract (immutable once deployed):
```solidity
uint256 public constant REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 2 hours;
uint256 public constant TEACHER_BONUS_PERCENT = 25;
uint256 public constant MAX_DISCOUNT_PERCENT = 15;
uint256 public constant TEO_TO_EUR_RATE = 10;
```
