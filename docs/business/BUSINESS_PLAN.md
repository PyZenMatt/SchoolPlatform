## ü™ô TEOCOIN DISCOUNT SYSTEM PARAMETERS

### Optimized Discount Structure (FINAL DECISION)

| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Maximum Discount** | **10%** | Conservative limit protecting platform margins |
| **Exchange Rate** | 1 TEO = ‚Ç¨0.067 | 150 TEO = ‚Ç¨10 discount |
| **Minimum Usage** | 75 TEO | Prevents micro-transactions |
| **Teacher Choice** | Accept/Decline per-sale | Teachers get notification and choose |
| **Teacher Compensation** | 50% EUR + 200% TEO | Double TEO + half the discounted EUR price |

### Teacher Notification & Choice System

When a student uses TeoCoin for a discount, the teacher receives an **instant notification** with two options:

#### Option 1: Accept TeoCoin Discount
- **Teacher gets**: 50% of discounted price + 200% of TEO used
- **Example**: ‚Ç¨100 course ‚Üí Student pays ‚Ç¨90 + 150 TEO ‚Üí Teacher gets ‚Ç¨45 + 150 TEO
- **Teacher benefit**: Receives TEO that can be staked for higher future commissions

#### Option 2: Decline TeoCoin Discount
- **Student payment**: Reverts to full price (‚Ç¨100)
- **Teacher gets**: Standard commission based on staking tier (50-75%)
- **No TEO transfer**: Student keeps their TEO, teacher gets only EUR

### Discount Examples by Course Price

| Course Price | Max Discount (10%) | TEO Required | Student Final Price | Teacher Choice | Teacher Gets (if accepts) |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| ‚Ç¨50 | ‚Ç¨5.00 | 75 TEO | ‚Ç¨45.00 | Accept/Decline | ‚Ç¨22.50 + 75 TEO |
