## üìä WHY 20% MAX DISCOUNT (vs 15% or 25%)

### ‚úÖ 20% is the Sweet Spot Because:

1. **Platform Sustainability**: Protects 17% net margin
2. **Student Value**: Meaningful savings without seeming "cheap"
3. **Teacher Protection**: Maintains attractive 75% payout
4. **Growth Potential**: Room to adjust upward if needed
5. **Competitive Edge**: Better than most platforms

### ‚ùå Why Not 15%?
- Too conservative, TeoCoin feels less valuable
- Harder to differentiate from competitors
- Students might not see enough incentive

### ‚ùå Why Not 25%+?
- Threatens platform sustainability
- Reduces funds available for teacher payouts
- Risk of margin compression

## üí∞ ECONOMIC EXAMPLES

### ‚Ç¨100 Course Sale with 20% TeoCoin Discount

#### Without TeoCoin (Base Commission):
```
Student Pays: ‚Ç¨100.00
Teacher Gets: ‚Ç¨50.00 (50%)
Platform Gets: ‚Ç¨47.00 (after fees)
```

#### With Maximum TeoCoin Discount (Diamond Staker):
```
Student Pays: ‚Ç¨80.00 (used 40 TEO)
Teacher Gets: ‚Ç¨60.00 (75% of ‚Ç¨80)
Platform Covers: ‚Ç¨20.00 discount
Platform Gets: ‚Ç¨20.00 (25% of ‚Ç¨80)
```

### Why This Works:
- **Student**: Saves ‚Ç¨20 with their earned TEO
- **Teacher**: Still gets full ‚Ç¨75 (unchanged)
- **Platform**: Small margin but builds loyalty & volume
