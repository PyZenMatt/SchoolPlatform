# 🔄 Hybrid Payment System: Stripe + TeoCoin Layer 2 Discounts

## 🎯 **THE HYBRID PAYMENT APPROACH**

### **Current System:**
- **Primary Payment**: Stripe (fiat) - always the main payment method
- **Optional Discount**: TeoCoin discount system using Layer 2 gas-free technology
- **Teacher Choice**: Receive TeoCoin from student OR get full fiat payment
- **Platform Commission**: 50% default, reducible to 25% with staking

---

## 💡 **HOW THE HYBRID SYSTEM WORKS**

### **Course Purchase Flow:**
```
1. Student browses courses (prices shown in EUR)
2. Student can apply TeoCoin discount (5%, 10%, or 15%)
3. If discount applied:
   ├── Student pays reduced EUR amount via Stripe
   ├── Student pays TeoCoin amount via Layer 2 (gas-free)
   └── Teacher chooses: receive TeoCoin OR full fiat payment
4. If no discount: Student pays full EUR amount via Stripe
```

### **Teacher Choice Mechanism:**
```
When student applies 15% discount on €100 course:

Option A - Receive TeoCoin:
├── Student: €85 Stripe + 150 TEO
├── Teacher: €42.5 fiat + 150 TEO (good for staking)
└── Platform: €42.5

Option B - Full Fiat Payment:
├── Student: 100 Stripe 
├── Teacher: €50 fiat 
└── Platform: 50€(based on the bronze staking)
```

## ⚡ **LAYER 2 DISCOUNT SYSTEM**

### **Gas-Free Student Experience:**
✅ **Zero Gas Fees**: Students don't pay gas for discount requests
✅ **Instant Approval**: Teachers approve/decline via platform  
✅ **Platform Covers Gas**: Seamless blockchain operations
✅ **Real TeoCoin**: Actual ERC-20 tokens transferred
✅ **2-Hour Timeout**: Requests auto-expire if not acted upon

### **Teacher Staking Benefits:**
✅ **Commission Reduction**: 50% → 25% platform commission
✅ **TeoCoin Accumulation**: Receive student TeoCoin for staking
✅ **Tier Progression**: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond
✅ **Immediate Benefits**: Instant commission rate changes
✅ **Real Ownership**: Stake actual TeoCoin in MetaMask wallet

### **Platform Economics:**
✅ **Sustainable Model**: Flexible teacher choice mechanism
✅ **Growth Incentive**: Teachers benefit from accumulating TeoCoin
✅ **User Adoption**: Gas-free experience for students
✅ **Trust Building**: Real blockchain tokens, not database credits

## 📱 **USER EXPERIENCE FLOW**

### **Teacher Dashboard View:**
```
🪙 MY TEOCOIN BALANCE

💰 Wallet Balance: 1,247 TEO
   └── Real TeoCoin in your MetaMask wallet
   └── [Deposit to Platform] button

🏦 Platform Balance: 853 TEO  
   └── Available for staking, marketing, discounts
   └── [Withdraw to Wallet] button

🔒 Staked Balance: 1,500 TEO (Gold Tier)
   └── Currently earning 19% commission rate
   └── [Unstake] button

📊 Total TEO Owned: 3,600 TEO
```

### **Student Discount Flow:**
```
1. Student wants 15% discount (30 TEO needed)
2. Check student balances:
   ├── Wallet: 45 TEO
   └── Platform: 12 TEO (total: 57 TEO ✅)
3. Student chooses payment method:
   ├── Use platform balance (instant)
   └── Transfer from wallet (5-10 min)
4. Discount applied based on choice
```

## ⚡ **INSTANT VS BLOCKCHAIN OPERATIONS**

### **Instant Operations (Virtual Balance):**
✅ **Staking/Unstaking**: Immediate tier changes
✅ **Marketing campaigns**: Instant activation
✅ **Discount applications**: Real-time processing
✅ **Platform rewards**: Immediate crediting

### **Blockchain Operations (Real Balance):**
🔗 **Earning rewards**: Real TEO minted to wallet
🔗 **Withdrawals**: Move from platform to wallet
🔗 **Deposits**: Move from wallet to platform
🔗 **External transfers**: Send to other wallets

---

## 🏦 **DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM**

### **Deposit Process (Wallet → Platform):**
```
1. Teacher clicks "Deposit TEO"
2. MetaMask transaction approval
3. Smart contract transfers TEO to platform
4. Platform credits virtual balance (1:1)
5. Teacher can use instantly for staking/marketing
```

### **Withdrawal Process (Platform → Wallet):**
```
1. Teacher clicks "Withdraw TEO"  
2. Platform burns virtual balance
3. Smart contract releases real TEO to wallet
4. Teacher sees balance in MetaMask
5. Can use in external DeFi or hold
```

### **Gas Fee Optimization:**
- **Polygon network**: ~$0.01 transaction fees
- **Batch operations**: Withdraw multiple rewards together
- **Platform subsidies**: Cover gas for large transactions
- **Layer 2 solutions**: Consider Arbitrum/Optimism

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Smart Contract Architecture:**
```solidity
contract TeoCoinPlatform {
    // Real ERC-20 TeoCoin contract
    IERC20 public teoCoin;
    
    // Virtual balance mapping
    mapping(address => uint256) public virtualBalance;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakedBalance;
    
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        teoCoin.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        virtualBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(virtualBalance[msg.sender] >= amount);
        virtualBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        teoCoin.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
    
    function stake(uint256 amount) external {
        require(virtualBalance[msg.sender] >= amount);
        virtualBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        stakedBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
        updateTier(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

### **Database Integration:**
```python
# Track both balances
class TeacherBalance(models.Model):
    teacher = models.ForeignKey(User)
    wallet_balance = models.DecimalField()  # Real TEO in wallet
    platform_balance = models.DecimalField()  # Virtual TEO on platform
    staked_balance = models.DecimalField()  # Staked virtual TEO
    
    @property
    def total_balance(self):
        return self.wallet_balance + self.platform_balance + self.staked_balance
```
