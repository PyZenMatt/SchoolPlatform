# SchoolPlatform Instructor Revenue Share

## Welcome to SchoolPlatform's Fair Revenue Sharing

SchoolPlatform is committed to creating a sustainable partnership with art educators, where instructors are rewarded fairly for creating exceptional content and building their student community. Unlike other platforms, we believe teachers deserve the majority of revenue from their hard work.

**There is no fee to create and host a course on SchoolPlatform, and you can publish as many free and paid courses as you like.**

## 💰 Instructor Revenue Share Overview

Our revenue sharing is **transparent and teacher-focused**. Below is our sharing plan for all course sales:

**Revenue shares are calculated on the Net Amount** - the amount a student paid less any applicable taxes, payment processing fees (Stripe ~3%), and currency conversion fees.

### 🎯 **SchoolPlatform Revenue Split**

#### **All Sales: 75% to Instructor, 25% to Platform**
- **Instructors receive 75%** of the net revenue for ALL sales
- **No complexity** - same great rate whether student finds you or we help promote
- **No hidden fees** - what you see is what you get

### 🆚 **How We Compare to Competitors**

| Platform | Instructor Share | Platform Share | Our Advantage |
|----------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
