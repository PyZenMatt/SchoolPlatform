✅ Switch to Polygon Amoy network automatically  
✅ Link wallet address to user account  
✅ Request withdrawal from DB balance  
✅ Real-time transaction status updates  
✅ View withdrawal history  
✅ Add TEO token to MetaMask  

**Security & Validation:**
✅ CSRF protection on all endpoints  
✅ User authentication required  
✅ Wallet address validation  
✅ Amount validation and limits  
✅ Network validation (Polygon Amoy only)  
✅ Transaction status tracking  

**Testing & Demo:**
✅ Complete user testing script  
✅ Demo environment with test balance addition  
✅ Live frontend testing interface  
✅ Integration testing with real contract  
✅ End-to-end flow validation  

### 🌐 **Live Demo URLs**

**Testing Environment:** http://localhost:8000/frontend/withdrawal/demo/
- Complete testing interface
- Add test TeoCoin balance
- Connect MetaMask wallet
- Test withdrawal flow
- Monitor transactions

**Withdrawal Interface:** http://localhost:8000/frontend/withdrawal/
- Production withdrawal interface
- MetaMask integration
- Real withdrawal processing

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /frontend/api/balance/` - Get user DB balance
- `POST /frontend/api/demo/add-balance/` - Add test balance (demo only)
- `POST /blockchain/v2/request-withdrawal/` - Request withdrawal
- `GET /blockchain/v2/withdrawal-status/{id}/` - Check status
- `POST /blockchain/v2/link-wallet/` - Link wallet address
- `GET /blockchain/v2/token-balance/` - Get blockchain balance

### 🎯 **User Testing Flow**

**Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
cd /home/teo/Project/school/schoolplatform
python test_complete_user_flow.py  # Verify backend
python manage.py runserver         # Start server
```

**Step 2: Frontend Testing**
1. Open http://localhost:8000/frontend/withdrawal/demo/
2. Add test TeoCoin balance using demo controls
3. Connect MetaMask wallet
4. Switch to Polygon Amoy network
5. Add TEO token to MetaMask
6. Request withdrawal
7. Monitor transaction in MetaMask

**Step 3: Verification**
- DB balance decreases by withdrawal amount
- Withdrawal request created in system
- MetaMask shows pending/completed transaction
- TEO tokens appear in wallet

### 📈 **Test Results**

### 🔄 **Complete User Journey**

1. **User logs into platform** → Has TeoCoin DB balance
2. **Opens withdrawal page** → `/frontend/withdrawal/` or `/frontend/withdrawal/demo/`
3. **Connects MetaMask** → Web3 wallet integration
4. **Switches network** → Polygon Amoy testnet
5. **Links wallet address** → Associates wallet with account
6. **Requests withdrawal** → Enters amount, submits form
7. **System processes** → Deducts DB balance, creates withdrawal request
8. **Background minting** → TeoCoin2 contract mints tokens to wallet
9. **User receives tokens** → Tokens appear in MetaMask
10. **Transaction complete** → User can use tokens on blockchain

### 🛠 **Phase 2 vs Phase 1 Improvements**

**Phase 1 Issues Solved:**
- ❌ Complex, confusing blockchain.py file
- ❌ Mixed legacy and new code
- ❌ No clear separation of concerns
- ❌ Limited frontend integration

**Phase 2 Solutions:**
- ✅ Clean, focused services.py
- ✅ Clear v2/ API endpoints
- ✅ Separated Phase 2 from legacy
- ✅ Complete MetaMask frontend
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ User-friendly demo environment

### 🎊 **Ready for Production**

**Phase 2 is complete and ready for:**
- User acceptance testing
- Production deployment
- Real user workflows
- MetaMask integration
- Blockchain token distribution

**All components working together:**
- Database TeoCoin service ↔️ Phase 2 blockchain service
- Django backend ↔️ MetaMask frontend  
- User authentication ↔️ Wallet linking
- Withdrawal requests ↔️ Token minting

### 🚀 **Next Steps**
