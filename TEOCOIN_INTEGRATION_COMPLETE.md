# 🚀 TeoCoin Withdrawal Integration Guide

## ✅ **Integration Complete!**

I've successfully integrated the TeoCoin withdrawal system into your existing React dashboards:

### 🔧 **Components Added**

**1. Main Components:**
- `src/components/TeoCoinWithdrawal/TeoCoinWithdrawal.jsx` - Full withdrawal dialog with MetaMask integration
- `src/components/TeoCoinBalanceWidget/TeoCoinBalanceWidget.jsx` - Dashboard widget for quick access

**2. Dashboard Integration:**
- **StudentDashboard** - Added side-by-side with existing TeoCoin dashboard
- **TeacherDashboard** - Added next to staking interface  
- **AdminDashboard** - Added as compact widget next to admin dashboard

### 🎯 **How It Works**

**User Flow:**
1. User sees TeoCoin balance widget in their dashboard
2. Clicks "Withdraw to MetaMask" button
3. MetaMask dialog opens with full withdrawal interface
4. User connects MetaMask, switches to Polygon Amoy
5. Enters withdrawal amount and submits
6. System deducts from DB balance and mints tokens to wallet

### 📍 **Dashboard Locations**

**Student Dashboard:**
```jsx
// Added next to existing StudentTeoCoinDashboard
<Row className="mb-4">
  <Col lg={6} className="mb-4">
    <StudentTeoCoinDashboard />  // Existing
  </Col>
  <Col lg={6} className="mb-4">
    <TeoCoinBalanceWidget />     // NEW - Full withdrawal widget
  </Col>
</Row>
```

**Teacher Dashboard:**
```jsx
// Added next to existing TeoCoin dashboard
<Row className="mb-4">
  <Col lg={6}>
    <StudentTeoCoinDashboard />  // Existing
  </Col>
  <Col lg={6}>
    <TeoCoinBalanceWidget />     // NEW - Full withdrawal widget
  </Col>
</Row>
```

**Admin Dashboard:**
```jsx
// Added as compact widget next to admin dashboard
<Row className="mt-4">

  </Col>
  <Col lg={4}>
    <TeoCoinBalanceWidget variant="compact" />  // NEW - Compact widget
  </Col>
</Row>
```

### 🔗 **API Integration**

The components use your existing authentication system:
```javascript
// Automatically includes bearer token from localStorage
const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /frontend/api/balance/` - Get user TeoCoin balance
- `POST /blockchain/v2/request-withdrawal/` - Request withdrawal
- `POST /blockchain/v2/link-wallet/` - Link MetaMask address
- `GET /blockchain/v2/withdrawal-history/` - Get withdrawal history

### 🚀 **Testing Instructions**
