## **🚀 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE - FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **Layer 2 Backend Proxy Architecture**
```
Student → Frontend → Backend API → Smart Contract
   ↓         ↓           ↓             ↓
No Gas    Clean UX   Platform Pays   Blockchain
```

### **Business Logic Flow**
1. **Student**: Applies discount, pays reduced EUR + signs TEO approval
2. **Platform**: Creates discount request, pays all gas fees
3. **Teacher**: Receives notification with EUR vs TEO choice
4. **System**: Handles both scenarios automatically

### **Core Components Status**
- ✅ **TeoCoinDiscountService**: Fully operational smart contract integration
- ✅ **Payment Views**: Complete API endpoints with Stripe integration  
- ✅ **Notification System**: Teacher and student alerts implemented
- ✅ **Database Models**: Enhanced CourseEnrollment with discount tracking
- ✅ **Configuration**: All settings and environment variables configured
