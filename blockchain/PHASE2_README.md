# TeoCoin Blockchain Phase 2 - Clean Implementation

## Overview

This is the Phase 2 implementation of the TeoCoin withdrawal system, designed to work with the existing TeoCoin2 contract at address `0x20D6656A31297ab3b8A87291Ed562D4228Be9ff8` on Polygon Amoy.

## What Was Cleaned Up

The blockchain app previously contained complex legacy code that was causing confusion. Phase 2 provides a clean, focused implementation:

### Removed/Simplified:
- Complex reward pool gas fee management
- Course payment via blockchain (moved to separate system)
- Complicated staking simulation
- Multiple conflicting TeoCoin service implementations
- Redundant ABI definitions

### Added/Clean:
- **`services.py`** - Clean blockchain service using existing TeoCoin2 contract
- **`clean_views.py`** - Simple, focused API endpoints for withdrawals
- **`clean_urls.py`** - Clean URL patterns
- Enhanced Phase 1 withdrawal system integration

## Key Components

### 1. TeoCoinBlockchainService (`services.py`)
Clean service that interfaces with the existing TeoCoin2 contract:
- `mint_tokens_to_address()` - Mint tokens to user's MetaMask (for withdrawals)
- `burn_tokens_from_address()` - Burn tokens from user's wallet (for deposits)
- `get_balance()` - Check wallet balance
- `get_transaction_receipt()` - Verify transactions

### 2. Clean API Endpoints (`clean_views.py`)
Focused endpoints with `v2/` prefix:
- `POST /blockchain/v2/request-withdrawal/` - Request withdrawal to MetaMask
- `GET /blockchain/v2/withdrawal-status/<id>/` - Check withdrawal status
- `GET /blockchain/v2/withdrawal-history/` - Get withdrawal history
- `POST /blockchain/v2/link-wallet/` - Link MetaMask address
- `GET /blockchain/v2/balance/` - Get wallet balance

### 3. Integration with Phase 1
Uses the comprehensive Phase 1 withdrawal service:
- Database balance validation
- Security checks and limits
- Automatic retry logic
- Management command for processing

## Contract Integration

### TeoCoin2 Contract Functions Used:
- `mintTo(address, amount)` - For processing withdrawals
- `burn(amount)` - For processing deposits (future)
- `balanceOf(address)` - For balance queries
- `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()` - For token info

### Security:
- Admin private key required for minting
- User private key required for burning
- Address validation for all operations
- Transaction receipt verification

## Usage Examples

### Request Withdrawal
```python
POST /blockchain/v2/request-withdrawal/
{
    "amount": "100.50",
    "metamask_address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D6Ac6F86C8cFc4Ae"
}
```

### Check Status
```python
GET /blockchain/v2/withdrawal-status/123/
```

### Link Wallet
```python
POST /blockchain/v2/link-wallet/
{
    "wallet_address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D6Ac6F86C8cFc4Ae"
}
```

## Legacy Support

Legacy endpoints remain available for backward compatibility but new development should use the `v2/` endpoints. The legacy system will be phased out gradually.

```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Phase 2 integration** - Verify withdrawal flow works end-to-end
2. **Frontend integration** - Update frontend to use v2/ endpoints
3. **Deposit system** - Implement burn-based deposit functionality
4. **Legacy deprecation** - Phase out complex legacy endpoints
5. **Production deployment** - Deploy with proper security measures

This Phase 2 implementation provides a clean foundation for the TeoCoin withdrawal system while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure.
