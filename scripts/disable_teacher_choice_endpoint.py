MIGRATION SCRIPT: Disable TeoCoin Rewards API Endpoint

This script safely disables the problematic /api/v1/teocoin/teacher/choice/ endpoint
by creating a simple replacement that returns a success message without processing.

The frontend has been updated to use only the notifications system which is working correctly.
