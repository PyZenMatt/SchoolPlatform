# ðŸ”” Teacher Notification System Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… **Navbar Cleanup** 
**Problem**: Teacher navbar showed both "Sistema Ricompense" and "Richieste Sconto TEO"
**Solution**: Merged into single "Gestione TEO" menu item

**Changed**: `frontend/src/menu-items-teacher.jsx`
- Removed: "Sistema Ricompense" menu item
- Kept: "Gestione TEO" (combined functionality)

### 2. âœ… **TeoCoin Crediting Implementation**
**Problem**: When teachers accepted TEO in notifications, no TeoCoin was actually credited
**Solution**: Implemented proper TeoCoin crediting through teacher absorption endpoint

**Changed**: 
- `frontend/src/components/teacher/UnifiedTeacherNotifications.jsx` - Added real TeoCoin crediting
- `api/teacher_absorption_views.py` - Enhanced `TeacherMakeAbsorptionChoiceView` to actually credit TEO

## Technical Implementation:

### Frontend Changes:
```jsx
// Before: Just marked notification as read
await markAsRead(notificationId);

// After: Actually credits TeoCoin when teacher chooses TEO
const creditResponse = await axiosClient.post('/api/v1/teocoin/teacher/choice/', {
  absorption_id: notificationId,
  choice: 'teo',
  amount: teoAmount,
  transaction_type: 'discount_absorption',
  description: `Discount absorption for course: ${courseTitle}`
});
```

### Backend Changes:
```python
# Enhanced endpoint to actually credit TeoCoin
from services.db_teocoin_service import DBTeoCoinService
from decimal import Decimal

db_service = DBTeoCoinService()
success = db_service.add_balance(
    user=request.user,
    amount=Decimal(str(amount)),
    transaction_type=transaction_type,
    description=description
)
```

## API Endpoint Used:
- **URL**: `/api/v1/teocoin/teacher/choice/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Process teacher discount absorption choice and credit TeoCoin

## Testing:
1. Teacher receives notification about student discount request
2. Teacher clicks "TEO" button in notification
3. System credits specified TEO amount to teacher's account
4. Notification is marked as read
5. Success message shows TEO amount credited

## Result:
- ðŸ”” Cleaner teacher navbar
- ðŸ’° Functional TeoCoin crediting when accepting discounts
- âœ… Proper user feedback on successful operations
