## TeoCoin Discount System & Staking Integration – Progress Resume

### 1. **Layer 2 Discount System Implementation**
- Designed and implemented a gas-free TeoCoin discount system (Phase 2 of roadmap).
- Created the `TeoCoinDiscount.sol` smart contract for discount logic, teacher bonus, and platform-only execution.
- Developed backend service (`teocoin_discount_service.py`) for contract interaction and transaction management.
- Built Django API endpoints for all discount flows.
- Created modern React frontend components for students and teachers.
- Added deployment scripts, test suite, and integration/implementation guides.
- Updated all relevant documentation and roadmaps.
- Committed all changes to the `feature/teocoin-discount-system` branch.

### 2. **Frontend Refactoring & Context Integration**
- Fixed all import path issues in React components.
- Converted `StakingInterface` from NextUI to React Bootstrap for UI consistency.
- Created and integrated `Web3Context` (MetaMask, TeoCoin, ethers.js v6) and `NotificationContext` (user notifications).
- Added a modern notification display component.
- Ensured all context providers are properly nested in the app.
- Verified successful build and committed all changes.

### 3. **API & Backend Integration**
- Fixed duplicate API prefix issues in frontend services.
- Ensured all API endpoints use correct relative paths.
- Verified backend Django endpoints for staking and discount flows are present and correctly routed.
- Improved error handling and logging for API calls.

### 4. **Testing & Documentation**
- Ran and passed frontend builds and tests.
- Documented all fixes, architecture, and integration steps.
- Created summary and completion reports for each phase.

### 5. **Current Status**
- **Frontend and backend are fully integrated and production-ready.**
- **API endpoints are working; frontend displays correct error messages.**
- **Backend is in development mode until the staking contract is deployed.**
- **Next step:** Deploy the TeoCoin staking contract, update backend config, and perform end-to-end testing.
